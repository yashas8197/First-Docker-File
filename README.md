# Node.js Docker Project

This project demonstrates how to use Docker to run a Node.js application.

## Description

This Docker project utilizes the official Node.js Docker image to set up a container environment for running a simple Node.js application.

## Usage

To build the Docker image, ensure you have Docker installed and follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Place your JavaScript file (`app.js`) containing your Node.js code in the same directory as the provided `Dockerfile`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile` and your `app.js` file.
5. Run the following command to build the Docker image:

    ```
    docker build -t my-node-app .
    ```

   Replace `my-node-app` with the desired name for your Docker image.

Once the Docker image is built, you can run a container based on that image using the following command:

The container will execute the `app.js` file, and you will see the output in your terminal or command prompt.

## Requirements

- Docker installed on your local machine.
